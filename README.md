# Kosmos client
## Installing
### Android
Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/lolocomotive/kosmos_client/releases) page and download the latest version (be sure to select the right achitecture, if you're not sure what that means, just select the file with no specific architecture, which should look like that `kosmos-client-28eef2.apk`)
### iOS
The app is not available on iOS since I don't have a Macbook or an iPhone, which makes it impossible to build the app for iOS. Feel free to implement iOS support if you have the tools required to do so.

## Contributing
Any contributions (Pull requests, feature requests and bug reports) are very welcome!
### Building 
It's just a normal flutter project (refer to the flutter documentation on how to build). You may encouter issues if you are trying to build without the git repository.
